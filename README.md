# Lunatask Plugin for Obsidian

This is an unofficial plugin that allows you to access information from your [Lunatask](https://lunatask.app) through [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

Made by [Yasmin Reina](https://github.com/yasminrei), a software engineer who wanted a way to link their Lunatask app with Obsidian.

Please note that thie plugin is not create by, affiliated with or supported by Lunatask or Obsidian.

## Note from the official Lunatask page
*"Lunatask API does not provide a way to read end-to-end encrypted data. Names of entities, notes, and other encrypted data cannot be read using the API, therefore the API does not return such data in responses. However, updating this data is allowed as well as creating new entities. To get this data out of the app, use data export instead."*
